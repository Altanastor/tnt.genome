# TnT Genome
TnT Genome is a javascript library for displaying genome based annotations. It has been built on top of the [TnT Board](http://emepyc.github.io/tnt.board/) library and shares with it the same philosophy and design principles: a powerful API written with flexibility in mind that allows the creation of simple, dynamic and useful genome-based visualisations. The goal of TnT Genome is not to provide a full-featured genome browser but a simple tool to create specific and simple genome views. Its flexibility also allows the exploration of new ways of visualising genome-based annotations.
